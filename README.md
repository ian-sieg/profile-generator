# profile-generator

## Description

This application runs entirely in Node. It prompts the user with questions to generate a quick team roster webpage that includes each employees role, name, id number and email address. It also includes links to any engineers' github pages, any interns' school names, or the office number for the team manager.

## Installation

## Testing

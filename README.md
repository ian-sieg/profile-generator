# profile-generator

## Description

This application runs entirely in Node. It prompts the user with questions to generate a quick team roster webpage that includes each employees role, name, id number and email address. It also includes links to any engineers' github pages, any interns' school names, or the office number for the team manager.

## Installation

Clone the Github repo to your device and download node.js. Also download the inquirer package from npm.

## Usage

Once installed, open your terminal or gitbash, navigate to the correct folder and type 'node index.js'. Answer the questions as they appear and select 'Finished' when you are done building your roster. You can find your new webpage within the 'dists' folder.

## Testing

Download Jest by running 'npm install --save-dev jest' in the command line while inside the main project folder. Then run 'npm test' to test whether each class runs correctly.
